            <p>Constructing a research paper is an integral part of being a graduate student in the Information
                Architecture,
                Technical Communication and Information Design, and Technical Communication programs at IIT.</p>

            <p>There is no right or wrong way to put a paper together, but there are a wealth of tools available to make
                the process efficient and manageable. In this course, you will find an explanation of the basic steps
                involved in writing a research paper, as well as a selection of tools that complement certain steps.</p>

            <p>If you are new to writing research papers, this course will guide you through each of the basic steps;
                even if you are an experienced writer, you can still refresh your knowledge with one or more lessons. To
                begin, choose a lesson by clicking one of the modules in the navigation above.</p>
